Placements at BIT Mesra

For decades now, the Campus Recruitment Programme of BIT has been an example for several other institutions by catering to the demands of the industry.

The Campus Recruitment Programme is organized as a central activity for BIT students from all centres at the Mesra Campus and also separately at the Deoghar, Jaipur, Noida, & Patna Campuses.

With their diverse yet in depth technical knowledge and well rounded soft skills, BIT students are industry ready to successfully contribute to any firm they become a part of. BIT has an excellent placement record and this is reflected in their consecutive campus recruitment drives. This bears testimony to the faith and confidence that the recruiters have on us. The satisfaction they gain from a well nurtured, competent, all-rounder BITian is, without any exaggeration, unparalleled.
