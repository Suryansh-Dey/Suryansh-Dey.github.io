# vinAIak training portal documentation
It is a website, for DESKTOP ONLY, to `train` the chat bot provided by vinAIak to your organisation.  
`train`: Editing the data based on which the chat bot will reply.
## Choosing topics
After you login with your credentials, you will see a line of `topics` upon which the chatbot is trained. Now, `topics` can be of two types:
- `File`: It contains the data, which can be text and files, based on which the bot will reply when question is asked related to that topic. Clicking on it opens the `editor`.
- `Folder`: It contains further more child `topics` which can be of any type, `file` and/or `folder`. Clicking on it creates a new line of it's child `topics`.
